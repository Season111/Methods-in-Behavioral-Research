We can be reached by cell phone almost anywhere, at almost any time. Text messages compete for our attention. Email and instant messaging (IM) can interrupt our attention whenever we are using a cell phone or computer. Is this a problem? Most people like to think of themselves as experts at multitasking. But can they be?</p><p>A study conducted by Bowman, Levine, Waite, and Gendron (2010) attempted to determine whether IMing during a reading session affected test performance. In this study, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: one where they were asked to IM prior to reading, one in which they were asked to IM during reading, and one in which IMing was not allowed at all. Afterward, all participants completed a brief test on the material presented in the reading.</p><p>First, acquire and read the article:</p><quote><p>Bowman, L. L., Levine, L. E., Waite, B. M., & Gendron, M. (2010). Can students really multitask? An experimental study of instant messaging while reading. <i>Computers & Education, 54,</i> 927â€“931. doi:10.1016/j.compedu.2009.09.024</p></quote><p>After reading the article, answer the following questions:</p><p>This experiment used an independent groups design.</p><blockquote><p>a. How could they have used a repeated measures design? What would have been the advantages and disadvantages of using a repeated measures design?<hr/></p><p>b. How could they have used a matched pairs design? What variables do you think would have been worthwhile to match participants on? What would have been the advantages and disadvantages of using a matched pairs design?</p></blockquote></div></h3><h2 style="color:orangered">Answer</h2><h3>Step 1 Of 2 </h3> <div class="answer"> <p>(a)</p> <p>The researchers could have used a repeated measures design by making the same group of students read the passages in all three levels of distraction. </p> <p>Advantages:</p> <p>1) As a result of not dividing the sample into three groups, the researchers would have gotten a large sample size for the repeated measures experiment.</p> <p>2) The students would realize the negative effects of instant messaging during studying and would make the required changes in their life.</p> <p>Disadvantages:</p> <p>1) Reading three passages would have been boring for the students and their performance would have gotten steadily worse with each task.</p> <p>2) The students might become better multi-taskers during the experiment (practice effect).</p> <p>3) The above order effects would create the requirement of counterbalancing. This in turn would negate the advantage of having a large sample size.</p> </div><img src='' />  <h3>Step 2 Of 2 </h3> <div class="answer"> <p>(b)</p> <p>The researcher could have used a matched pairs design to make more equivalent groups. The variables they could have used could be:</p> <p>1) Reading comprehension ability.</p> <p>2) Attention span.</p> <p>3) Multitasking ability.</p> <p>4) Reading speed.</p> <p>Advantages:</p> <p>1) The researcher will achieve more equivalent groups.</p> <p>2) The researcher can have small sample size.</p> <p>3) The results will be more reliable than an experiment with random assignment unless that experiment has a very large sample size.</p> <p>Disadvantages:</p> <p>1) Testing the students before the actual test will make them nervous or may make them perform better or worse than they usually do.</p> <p>2) Testing the students on any one variable may not be enough to rank them. For example, a student with excellent reading comprehension may have poor multitasking ability and vice versa.</p> <p>3) The students may get bored from the preliminary tests.</p></div><img src='' />  </body></html>
