Use two levels of the independent variable: a “professional style” presentation (high-quality paper, consistent use of margins and fonts, carefully constructed tables and charts) and a “nonprofessional style” (average-quality paper, frequent changes in the margins and fonts, tables and charts lacking proper labels). Discuss the necessity for using counterbalancing. Create a table illustrating the experimental design.</p></div></h3><h2 style="color:orangered">Answer</h2><h3>Step 1 Of 3 </h3> <div class="answer"> <p>This study will have the following variables:</p> <p> <b>Independent variable:</b> </p> <p>Conceptual definition: Report presentation style.</p> <p>Operational definition: Professional (P) or unprofessional (UP)</p> <p> <b>Dependent variable:</b> </p> <p>Conceptual definition: Grade received in report.</p> <p>Operational definition: A, B, C, D</p> <p>It will have a total of 30 participants. All participants will receive both orders of the independent variable manipulation.</p> </div><img src='' />  <h3>Step 2 Of 3 </h3> <div class="answer"> <p>Counterbalancing in this case is important for the following reasons.</p> <p> <u>If the professionally written report (P) was presented before the unprofessionally written report (UP)</u>:</p> <p>Reading the P report may increase the readers’ expectation which may cause them grade the UP report lower than they otherwise would have. On the other hand, reading the P report may put them in good mood and make them more forgiving while grading the UP report.</p> <p> <u>If the unprofessionally written report (UP) was presented before the professionally written report (P)</u>:</p> <p>Reading the UP report may irritate the readers and cause them to grade the P report lower than they otherwise would have. On the other hand, reading the UP report may lower their expectation and cause them grade the P report higher than they otherwise would have.</p> </div><img src='' />  <h3>Step 3 Of 3 </h3> <div class="answer"> <p>The following table summarized the experimental design:</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/5b9/5b9b0162-bb31-41e9-b5fb-59977e356a3d/512112-8-2AQ-i1.png" alt="Picture 1" /> </p></div><img src='' />  </body></html>
