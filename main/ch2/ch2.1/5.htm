We can be reached by cell phone almost anywhere, at almost any time. Text messages compete for our attention. Email and instant messaging (IM) can interrupt our attention whenever we are using a cell phone or computer. Is this a problem? Most people like to think of themselves as experts at multitasking. But can they be?</p><p>A study conducted by Bowman, Levine, Waite, and Gendron (2010) attempted to determine whether IMing during a reading session affected test performance. In this study, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: one where they were asked to IM prior to reading, one in which they were asked to IM during reading, and one in which IMing was not allowed at all. Afterward, all participants completed a brief test on the material presented in the reading.</p><p>First, acquire and read the article:</p><quote><p>Bowman, L. L., Levine, L. E., Waite, B. M., & Gendron, M. (2010). Can students really multitask? An experimental study of instant messaging while reading. <i>Computers & Education, 54,</i> 927â€“931. doi:10.1016/j.compedu.2009.09.024</p></quote><p>After reading the article, answer the following questions:</p><p>How good was the internal validity of this experiment?</p></div></h3><h2 style="color:orangered">Answer</h2><h3>Step 1 Of 2 </h3> <div class="answer"> <p>With the enhancement of technology, it is easy to do internet messaging. In the internet messaging one can easily send the message through mobile and different modes. One can use different forms for internet messaging like media and emails which are used to transmit the message from one place to another. A different aspect is used for the communication process and these are transmitted with the help of wireless telecommunication.</p> </div><img src='' />  <h3>Step 2 Of 2 </h3> <div class="answer"> <p>Internal validity of an experiment is the form of evidence support and the related claims to be caused and affected. Most important internal validity of this experiment involved because of the existence of problem defined in this case study the Internet messaging and Technology through which the lives of people are affected. Internal validity of this experiment involves both cause and the effect. In this case study, it is mentioned that the participants are provided with three different conditions in which some are using instant messaging while some are not. This is the form of extent in which alternative findings are available; they are also responsible to justify the conclusion based on texts.</p></div><img src='' />  </body></html>
