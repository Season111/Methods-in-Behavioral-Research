We can be reached by cell phone almost anywhere, at almost any time. Text messages compete for our attention. Email and instant messaging (IM) can interrupt our attention whenever we are using a cell phone or computer. Is this a problem? Most people like to think of themselves as experts at multitasking. But can they be?</p><p>A study conducted by Bowman, Levine, Waite, and Gendron (2010) attempted to determine whether IMing during a reading session affected test performance. In this study, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: one where they were asked to IM prior to reading, one in which they were asked to IM during reading, and one in which IMing was not allowed at all. Afterward, all participants completed a brief test on the material presented in the reading.</p><p>First, acquire and read the article:</p><quote><p>Bowman, L. L., Levine, L. E., Waite, B.

They may affect the dependent variable such that it is not possible to confirm that the change in dependent variable is solely due to the independent variable. Thus, confounders decrease the internal validity of the experiment.</p> </div><img src='' />  <h3>Step 2 Of 2 </h3> <div class="answer"> <p>The following are the potential confounders in this experiment.</p> <p>1) Basic reading comprehension skills</p> <p>2) Attention span.</p> <p>3) Reading speed.</p> <p>4) General intelligence</p> <p>5) Multitasking abilities.</p> <p>6) Student’s major. Students who major in subjects that require them to read and memorize large amount of material may have higher reading speed and recall ability.</p> <p>7) Other distractions in the classroom or surrounding of the experimental setting.</p> <p>8) Type of conversations during the instant messaging (IM). More engrossing IM conversations cause more distractions.</p> <p>9) Mood of the participant on that particular day.</p></div><img src='' />  </body></html>
