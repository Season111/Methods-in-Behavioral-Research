We can be reached by cell phone almost anywhere, at almost any time. Text messages compete for our attention. Email and instant messaging (IM) can interrupt our attention whenever we are using a cell phone or computer. Is this a problem? Most people like to think of themselves as experts at multitasking. But can they be?</p><p>A study conducted by Bowman, Levine, Waite, and Gendron (2010) attempted to determine whether IMing during a reading session affected test performance. In this study, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: one where they were asked to IM prior to reading, one in which they were asked to IM during reading, and one in which IMing was not allowed at all. Afterward, all participants completed a brief test on the material presented in the reading.</p><p>First, acquire and read the article:</p><quote><p>Bowman, L. L., Levine, L. E., Waite, B. M., & Gendron, M. (2010). Can students really multitask? An experimental study of instant messaging while reading. <i>Computers & Education, 54,</i> 927–931. doi:10.1016/j.compedu.2009.09.024</p></quote><p>After reading the article, answer the following questions:</p><p>In what way does this study reflect—or not reflect—the reality of studying and test taking in college? That is, how would you evaluate the external validity of this study?</p></div></h3><h2 style="color:orangered">Answer</h2><h3>Step 1 Of 3 </h3> <div class="answer"> <p>Internet messaging (IM) plays an important role in everyday life. There are different processes, instrument as well as applications that are used to enhance and simplify our need for daily life. The Internet plays an important role and technology for well communication and connectivity. This has both positive and negative impact on our life security and privacy. Before the internet, it was good to communicate with someone with the help of physical appearance. But, today people do not need to or have a postage stamp they just simply call on the telephone and take the follow up on the health and impact through internet messaging.</p> </div><img src='' />  <h3>Step 2 Of 3 </h3> <div class="answer"> <p>Confounding variables are those variables that cannot be controlled and damage the validity of the experiment. In this case, study the technology place both positive and negative role in human life. The best potential variable that can we think of involved the control of usage of technology in the routine life. It is very commonly observed that people are using their cell phones all the time but it should not be allowed or some restrictions should be controlled by the government. </p> </div><img src='' />  <h3>Step 3 Of 3 </h3> <div class="answer"> <p>In this case study, it was clearly mentioned that the students are provided with a different form of conditions in which they are asked to have internet message in prior to reading one is asked to have internet messaging during reading as another one was not allowed to use this at all. This has a great effect by using this experimental design. Students are considered as the youth and their feedback is very important to understand the mentality youth. The reality of studying and taking the test in the college will define the mental status of the students. This is the best way to evaluate the validity of this study because they are much better subject with which one can easily understand that how and what students actually need to have.</p></div><img src='' />  </body></html>
