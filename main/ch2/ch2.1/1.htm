We can be reached by cell phone almost anywhere, at almost any time. Text messages compete for our attention. Email and instant messaging (IM) can interrupt our attention whenever we are using a cell phone or computer. Is this a problem? Most people like to think of themselves as experts at multitasking. But can they be?</p><p>A study conducted by Bowman, Levine, Waite, and Gendron (2010) attempted to determine whether IMing during a reading session affected test performance. In this study, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: one where they were asked to IM prior to reading, one in which they were asked to IM during reading, and one in which IMing was not allowed at all. Afterward, all participants completed a brief test on the material presented in the reading.</p><p>First, acquire and read the article:</p><quote><p>Bowman, L. L., Levine, L. E., Waite, B.

As a result, they may put more effort than normal.</p> <p>2) On the other hand, the participants may get bored from reading a passage in the pretest and based on attention span and general attitude, perform poorly in the actual test.</p></div><img src='' />  </body></html>
